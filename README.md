YouKok2 is available at [youkok2.com](http//youkok2.com).

## Get started

To contribute developing YouKok2, simply clone the repository and run the shell script `_scripts/install.sh`. It will guide you through the setup process. After the process you should be able to run the application on Linux and Mac OS X. Making stuff work on Windows has not been focused on yet. Hopefully we will make that work in the future.

## Technologies

YouKok2 uses various technologies to work. Most of which has been written from the ground up. This includes a dynamic URL pattern matching, a robust MVC pattern, a minimalistic ORM and a processor handler. Details on this can be found in the Wiki.
